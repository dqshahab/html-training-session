        <h2>Definition</h2>

        <p style="color:blueviolet">
            Aerodynamics is the study of how gases, specifically air, interact with objects as they move through it. <br/> 
            It focuses on understanding and analyzing the forces and motions that occur during the flow of air over and around solid objects, such as aircraft, cars, buildings, and even natural structures.<br/> 
            <span style="color:orangered">
                Aerodynamics plays a crucial role in various fields, including aerospace engineering, automotive design, wind energy, and sports.  <br/>
            </span>
            By studying aerodynamics, engineers and scientists aim to optimize the performance, efficiency, stability, and safety of objects in motion, particularly when they are subjected to air resistance or lift forces. <br/>
